spectrogram
===========

A simple scrolling spectrogram app for spotify.


installation
------------

 * On a Mac clone/copy the spectrogram directory into a ~/Spotify/spectrogram/ directory
 * On Windows clone/copy the spectrogram directory into a "My Documents\Spotify\spectrogram\" directory

You should then be able to type "spotify:app:spectrogram" into the search bar.  If that doesn't work
then you may have to set up a dev account.


TODO
 * Maybe some kind of colour choosing system (I love the current one, but I know it's not everyone's style)
