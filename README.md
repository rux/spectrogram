spectrogram
===========

A simple scrolling spectrogram for spotify.  Runs as an app.

Currently under dev, and I'm on a Mac, so to test it, clone into a ~/Spotify/spectrogram/ directory.

You should then be able to type "spotify:app:spectrogram" into the search bar.  If that doesn't work
then you may have to set up a dev account.  Not really sure, never done one of these before.


TODO
 * Resize when the app window resizes (currently apple-R for a reload will fix any oddness with widths)
 * Grows in height to fill the window (currently fixed at 512px)
 * Maybe some kind of colour choosing system (I love the current one, but I know it's not everyone's style)
